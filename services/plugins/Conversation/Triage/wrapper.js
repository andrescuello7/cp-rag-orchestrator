            'answer' (str): The answer to the request. Defaults to an empty string if not found.
            'search_query' (str): The search query for the request. Defaults to an empty string if not found.
            'prompt_tokens' (list): The prompt tokens from the function result. 
            'completion_tokens' (list): The completion tokens from the function result.
            'bypass' (bool): A flag indicating whether to bypass the reminder flow steps (in case an error has occurred).
